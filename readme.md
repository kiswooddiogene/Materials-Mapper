# 🏗 Construction Material Mapper 🌍

## About The Project
This project is designed to simplify the process of mapping out the origins of construction materials. This is a project is a fun integration that not only maps materials but also makes project planning more efficient and visually engaging.

### Built With
This project harnesses the capabilities of several key Python packages:
- 🐼 `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- 🌐 `geopy` (specifically `ArcGIS`) for geocoding addresses.
- 🗺 `folium` for interactive map creation.


### Goals 🎯
The primary objective is to utilize the `DataFrame` to identify the necessary construction materials for your project. Enter the materials you're searching for, and let the code do the rest. By leveraging the `folium` package, it generates a dynamic map pinpointing the geographic origins of these materials based on latitude and longitude data.

### Synthetic Data 🔄
This is synthetic data that was used to perform this. The packages compliment each other well in making this a fun project.
